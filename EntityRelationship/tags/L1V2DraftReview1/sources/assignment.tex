\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Assignment}}\label{sec:assignment}

\glyph{Assignment} is used to describe the setting of a state variable to a certain value. The assignment, represented by an harpoon arrow, goes from one or more \glyph{variable values} to a variable identification, represented by a \glyph{state variable} attached to the entity affected by the assignment. If an \glyph{assignment} takes several \glyph{state variable} values as input, there is an implicit XOR between them, located at the point of junction between the arcs coming from the alternative values. Since only one value can be assigned at a time, there is therefore no edge overlap in the assignment itself. The result of an assignment is represented by \glyph{outcomes}, that is by filled dots on the arrow. The result of an \glyph{assignment} can be represented by any number of \glyph{outcomes}. In the case of more than one \glyph{state variable} values, the \glyph{outcomes} must be placed on the relevant incoming branch.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000464 ! state variable assignment
 \glyphOrigin One or more variable value (section \sect{variableValue}) on their own, each containing a variable value.
 \glyphTarget A state-variable (section \sect{stateVariable}) carried by a interactor (section \sect{interactors}), containing a variable identification.
 \glyphEndPoint The target extremity of an \glyph{assignment} carries an harpoon arrowhead.
