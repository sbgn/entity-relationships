\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Modulation}}\label{sec:modulation}

A \glyph{modulation} affects the propensity, or the chances to happen, of the target relationship. Such a modulation can affect the relationship \textbf{positively or negatively}, or even both ways depending on the conditions. A \glyph{modulation} can also be used when one does not know the precise direction of the effect, for instance if there are conflicting evidences.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000168 ! control.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{entity node} (\sect{ENs}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{relationship} (\sect{relationships}).
 \glyphEndPoint The target extremity of a \glyph{modulation} carries an empty diamond.
 \glyphAux A \glyph{unit of information} carrying the mention \glyph{cis} or \glyph{trans} precises the relationship between the \glyph{entity node} from which the \glyph{modulation} origins and either:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \glyph{entity node} from which the influence targeted by the \glyph{modulation} origins
\item all the relevant \glyph{interactors} of the \glyph{interaction} targeted by the \glyph{modulation}
\item the \glyph{entity} subjected to the \glyph{assignment} targeted by the \glyph{modulation}
\end{itemize}
 \end{glyphDescription}
