\section{Relationships}\label{sec:relationships}

\glyph{Relationships} are rules that decide of the existence of entity nodes, based on the existence of others. 
%In ontology parlance, they would be ``occurants''. 
\SBGNERLone{} provides two types of relationships, the statements and the influences.

\subsection{Statements}\label{sec:statements}

\glyph{Statements} can be true or false. \glyph{Statements} are targets of \glyph{influences}. They are not true themselves, but can carry truth element (\glyph{outcomes}, see \sect{outcome}). \SBGNERLone{} provides three types of statements, \glyph{assignment}, \glyph{interaction} and \glyph{phenotype}.

\subsection{Influences}\label{sec:influences}

Influence arcs represent the effect of an entity on another relationship. The symbols attached to their extremities precise their semantics. SBGN \ERs{}' influences can be viewed as logical rules linking \glyph{ENs} and other rules. \SBGNERLone{} provides seven influences, \glyph{modulation}, \glyph{stimulation}, \glyph{inhibition}, \glyph{necessaryStimulation}, \glyph{absoluteInhibition}, \glyph{absoluteStimulation}, \glyph{logicArc}.
