\chapter{Complete examples of \SBGNERLone maps}

The following diagrams present complete examples of SBGN Entity Relationships representing Biological processes. They by no mean exhaust the possibilities of  \SBGNERLone.

\fig{PCR} presents the different relations between the four entities involved in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This examplifies the use of the \glyph{entity}, the logical operator \glyph{or}, the \glyph{state variable} ``existence'', the \glyph{unit of information}, as well as the relationships \glyph{interaction}, \glyph{assignment}, \glyph{necessary stimulation} and \glyph{absolute inhibition}.
