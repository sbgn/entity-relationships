\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Modulation}}\label{sec:modulation}

A modulation affects the strength, or the probability to exist, of the target relationship. Such a modulation can affect the relationship \textbf{positively or negatively}, or even both ways depending on the conditions. A \glyph{modulation} can also be used when one does not know the precise direction of the effect, for instance if there are conflicting evidence.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000168 ! control.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{entity node} (\sect{ENs}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{relationship} (\sect{relationships}).
 \glyphEndPoint The target extremity of a \glyph{modulation} carries an empty diamond.
 \end{glyphDescription}
