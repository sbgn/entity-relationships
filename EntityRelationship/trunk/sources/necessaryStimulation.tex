\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Necessary stimulation}}\label{sec:necessaryStimulation}

A necessary stimulation is an influence that has to be present for a relationship to take place (to become true). A relationship modulated by a necessary stimulation can only exist when this stimulation is true, whatever are the other influences this relationship is subjected to.

\begin{glyphDescription}
