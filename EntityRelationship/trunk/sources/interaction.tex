\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Interaction}}\label{sec:interaction}

\glyph{Interaction} represents an interaction between two or more \glyph{entities} or \glyph{outcomes}, whether a non-covalent physical interaction, or a functional interaction, e.g. genetic interaction. Each arrowhead points to an interactor involved in the interaction. The result of the interaction is represented by \glyph{outcomes} (see section \ref{sec:outcome}), that is by filled dots on the line linking the two arrowheads in the case of a binary interaction, on a circle linked to the edges coming from the arrowheads in the case of a  n-ary interactions. The result of an interaction can be represented by any number of \glyph{outcomes}.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000342 molecular or genetic interaction
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{interactor} (\sect{interactors}) or  \glyph{unit of information} (\sect{unitInformation}) carried by an \glyph{entity} (\sect{entity}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{interactor} (\sect{interactors}) or  \glyph{unit of information} (\sect{unitInformation}) carried by an \glyph{entity} (\sect{entity}).
 \glyphEndPoint Both origin and target extremities of an \glyph{interaction} carry an harpoon arrowhead. In the case of n-ary interactions, the arrows pointing to the \glyph{interactors} originate from a circle. The interaction can be decorated by unit of information representing the cardinality (the number of instances of an entity taking part in an interaction), or specifying in the case of homo-interactions, if the interaction is \emph{cis}, that is between two parts of the same instance of an entity, or \emph{trans}, that is between different instances of an entity.
