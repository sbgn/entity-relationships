\section{Entity nodes}\label{sec:ENs}

\glyph{Entity nodes} (ENs) represent element of truth, class of things that exist. 
%In ontology parlance, they would be ``continuants''. 
Entity nodes are the source of \glyph{influences} (\sect{influences}). \SBGNERLone{} provides three different types of \glyph{entity nodes}, the \glyph{interactors}, the \glyph{logical operators} and the \glyph{perturbing agent}. 

\subsection{Interactors}\label{sec:interactors}

Interactors are entity nodes that are able to participate in an interaction (\sect{interaction}). \SBGNERLone{} provides two interactors, the \glyph{entity} and the \glyph{outcome} of a statement.

\subsection{Logical operators}\label{sec:logic}

A \glyph{logical operator} allows to combine elements of truth into another element of truth (if A exists and B exits, then A AND B exists) in order ot apply influences. \SBGNERLone{} provides four \glyph{logical operators}, \glyph{and}, \glyph{or}, \glyph{not} and \glyph{delay}.
