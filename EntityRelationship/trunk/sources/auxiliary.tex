\section{Auxiliary units}\label{sec:aux}

\glyph{Auxiliary units} are decorations used on \glyph{entities} (\sect{entity}), \glyph{interactions} (\sect{interaction})  and \glyph{influences} (\sect{influences}) to further refine their semantics.  \SBGNERLone{} provides two \glyph{auxiliary units}, the \glyph{unit of information} and the \glyph{state variable}.
