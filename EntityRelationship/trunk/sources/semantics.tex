\section{Semantic description of \ER{} diagrams}

\subsection{Statements}

\paragraph
An \glyph{interaction} linking the \glyph{interactors} A and B means: \emph{A interacts with B}. An \glyph{outcome} on an \glyph{interaction} represents the cases when the statement is true, that is the interaction effectively exists. If the interaction is a physical interaction between molecules, the \glyph{outcome} represents the complex resulting from the interaction. It is used as follow: \emph{when (or if) A interacts with B then}.

\paragraph
Assignement:

a assigned to A

outcome: if a assigned to A then (outcome = A{a})

\subsection{Influences}

Modulation:

If A then R is either reinforced or weakened

Stimulation:

if A then R is reinforced

Necessary stimulation: 

Inhibition:

If A then R is weakened

if A then R 

Absolute inhibition:

if A then non R

\subsection{Logical Operators}

and:

if A and B then

or:

if A or B then

not:

if not A then
