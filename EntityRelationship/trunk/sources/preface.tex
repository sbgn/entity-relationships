\chapter{Preface}

The present document describes \SBGNERLone. The chapter \chap{glyph} on page ~\pageref{chp:glyph}provides a catalog of the graphical symbols available for representing entities nodes and relationships in \ER diagrams. It is targeted to all audiences, wanting to generate or interpret \ER diagrams, and is (hopefully) not too technical. In \chap{grammar} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:grammar}, we describe the rules for combining these glyphs into a legal SBGN \ER, and in \chap{layout} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:layout}, we describe requirements and guidelines for the way that diagrams are visually organized. Those chapters are targeted to people wishing to generate SBGN diagrams, whether manually or automatically, and are more technical.

The authors would like to acknowledge especially the help of Frank Bergmann, Sarala Dissanayake, Ralph Gauges, Peter Ghazal, and Lu Li. SM and AS would also like to acknowledge Igor Goryanin whose financial support and encouragement enabled us to commit the necessary time to the development of this specification.

% The development of SBGN was mainly supported by a grant from the Japanese \emph{New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization} (NEDO, \url{http://www.nedo.go.jp/}).  The \emph{Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology} (OIST, \url{http://www.oist.jp/}), the \emph{AIST Computational Biology Research Center} (AIST CBRC, \url{http://www.cbrc.jp/index.eng.html}) the British \emph{Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council} (BBSRC, \url{http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/}) through a Japan Partnering Award, the European Media Laboratory (EML Research gGmbH, \url{http://www.eml-r.org/}), and the Beckman Institute at the California Institute of Technology (\url{http://bnmc.caltech.edu}) provided additional support for SBGN workshops.  Some help was provided by the \emph{Japan Science and Technology Agency} (JST, \url{http://www.jst.go.jp/}) and the \emph{Genome Network Project} of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science, and Technology (MEXT, \url{http://www.mext.go.jp/}) for the development of the gene regulation network aspect of SBGN, and from the \emph{Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council} (EPSRC, \url{http://www.epsrc.ac.uk}) during the redaction of the specification.

\section*{Notes on typographical conventions}

The concept represented by a glyph is written using a normal font, while a \glyph{glyph} means the SBGN visual representation of the concept. Note on the color code: \textcolor{blue}{The glyphs that have been thorougly discussed, and are considered frozen, are represented in blue}. \textcolor{ForestGreen}{The glyphs that have been thorougly discussed, but are still posing problems are represented in green}. \textcolor{red}{The glyphs that have been proposed but for which in-depth discussion is yet to come are represented in red}.
