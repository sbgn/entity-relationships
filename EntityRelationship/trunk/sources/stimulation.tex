\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Stimulation}}\label{sec:stimulation}
\color{blue}

A stimulation affects \textbf{positively} the strength, or the probability, of the target relationship. This stimulation can be for instance a catalysis or a positive allosteric regulation.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000170 ! stimulation.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{entity node} (\sect{ENs}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{relationship} (\sect{relationships}).
