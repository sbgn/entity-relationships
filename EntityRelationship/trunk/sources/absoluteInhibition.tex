\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Absolute inhibition}}\label{sec:absoluteInhibition}

An absolute inhibition precludes the existence of another relationship. 

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000171 ! absolute inhibition.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{interactor} (\sect{interactors}) or any \glyph{logical operator} (\sect{logic}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{statement} (\sect{statements}) or \glyph{influence} (\sect{influences}).
 \glyphEndPoint The target extremity of a \glyph{absolute inhibition} carries a double bar perpendicular to the arc (to remind that it is an \glyph{inhibition}).
 \end{glyphDescription}

% The example in \fig{trigger-gene} below describes the transcription of a gene~X, that is the creation of a messenger RNA~X triggered by the gene~X.  The creation of the protein~X is then triggered by the mRNA~X.  (Note that the same example could be represented using the gene as reactant and product, although it is semantically different.)

% The example in \fig{trigger-calcium} below describes the transport of calcium ions out of the endoplasmic reticulum. Without IP3 receptor, there is not calcium flux, therefore, one cannot use a \glyph{stimulation}. The trigger instead represents this absolute stimulation.
