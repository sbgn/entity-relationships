\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Non-Interaction}}\label{sec:non-interaction}

\glyph{Non-interaction} represents the absence of an interaction between two or more \glyph{entities} or \glyph{outcomes}, whether a non-covalent physical interaction, or a functional interaction, e.g. genetic interaction. Each arrowhead points to an interactor involved in the absent interaction. The result of the non-interaction is represented by \glyph{outcomes} (see section \ref{sec:outcome}), that is by filled dots on the line linking the two arrowheads in the case of a binary interaction, on a circle linked to the edges coming from the arrowheads in the case of a  n-ary interactions. The result of an interaction can be represented by any number of \glyph{outcomes}.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:NEW
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{interactor} (\sect{interactors}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{interactor} (\sect{interactors}).
 \glyphEndPoint Both origin and target extremities of an \glyph{interaction} carry an harpoon arrowhead. The absence of the interaction is denoted by two parallel bar perpendicular to the arc.
