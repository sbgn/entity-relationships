\chapter{Entity Relationship Glyphs}

This chapter provides a catalog of the graphical symbols available for representing entities in \ER diagrams.  There are different classes of glyphs corresponding to different classes of entities, predicates, controls and operators.

In \chap{grammar} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:grammar}, we describe the rules for combining these glyphs into a legal SBGN \ER, and in \chap{layout} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:layout}, we describe requirements and guidelines for the way that diagrams are visually organized.

 \section{Interactor nodes}\label{sec:interactors}

\SBGNERLone{} contains three glyphs representing classes of interactors: \glyph{entity} (\sect{entity}), \glyph{perturbing agent} (\sect{perturbation}) and \glyph{outcome} (\sect{outcome}). Entities can optionally carry auxiliary units such as \glyph{units of information} (\sect{unitInfornation}) and \glyph{state variables} (\sect{stateVariable}).

\section{influences}\label{sec:influences}

Influence arcs represent the effect of an entity on another relationship. The symbols attached to their extremities precise their semantics. \SBGNERLone's influences can be viewed as logical rules linking interactors and other rules.
