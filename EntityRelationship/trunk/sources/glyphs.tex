\chapter{Entity Relationship Glyphs}

This chapter provides a catalog of the graphical symbols available for representing entities in \ER diagrams.  There are different classes of glyphs corresponding to different classes of entities, predicates, controls and operators.

In \chap{grammar} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:grammar}, we describe the rules for combining these glyphs into a legal SBGN \ER, and in \chap{layout} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:layout}, we describe requirements and guidelines for the way that diagrams are visually organized.

\section{Entity nodes}\label{sec:ENs}

In \SBGNERLone{} entity nodes represent element of truth, things that exist. In ontology parlance, they would be ``continuants''. Entity nodes are the source of influences. \SBGNERLone{} contains three different types of entity nodes, the interactors, that are entities able to interact, the logical operators and the \glyph{perturbing agent}.

In \SBGNERLone{}, logical operator allow to combine element of truth into another element of truth (if A exists and B exits, then A AND B exists) in order ot apply influences.

\section{Relationships}\label{sec:relationships}

In \SBGNERLone{} relationships are rules that decide of the existence of entity nodes, based on the existence of others. In ontology parlance, they would be ``occurants''. \SBGNERLone{} contains two types of relationships, the statements and the influences.

\subsection{Statements}\label{sec:statements}

In \SBGNERLone{}, statements can be true or false. Statements are targets of influences. They are not true themselves, but can carry truth element (\glyph{outcomes}, see \sect{outcome}).

\subsection{influences}\label{sec:influences}

Influence arcs represent the effect of an entity on another relationship. The symbols attached to their extremities precise their semantics. \SBGNERLone's influences can be viewed as logical rules linking interactors and other rules.
