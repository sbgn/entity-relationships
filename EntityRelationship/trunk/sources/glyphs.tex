\chapter{Entity Relationship Glyphs}

[Note on the color code: \textcolor{blue}{The glyphs that have been thorougly discussed, and are considered frozen, are represented in blue}. \textcolor{green}{The glyphs that have been thorougly discussed, but are still posing problems are represented in green}. \textcolor{red}{The glyphs that have been proposed but for which in-depth discussion is yet to come are represented in red}.]

This chapter provides a catalog of the graphical symbols available for representing entities in \ER diagramss.  There are different classes of glyphs corresponding to different classes of material or conceptual entities, containers, processes, connecting arcs, and logical operators.  In \chap{grammar} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:grammar}, we describe the rules for combining these glyphs into a legal SBGN \ER, and in \chap{layout} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:layout}, we describe requirements and guidelines for the way that diagrams are visually organized.

 \section{Entity nodes}\label{sec:ENs}

 \SBGNERLone{} contains four glyphs representing classes of material entities: \glyph{unspecified entity}, \glyph{simple chemical}, \glyph{macromolecule} and \glyph{genetic entity}.  (Specific types of macromolecules, such as protein, RNA, DNA, polysaccharide, and specific simple chemicals are not defined by \SBGNERLone but may be part of future levels of SBGN.)  In addition to the material entities, \SBGNERLone{} represents five conceptual entities: \glyph{source/sink}, \glyph{perturbation}, \glyph{observable}, \glyph{tag} and \glyph{outcome}.  Material and conceptual entities can optionally carry auxiliary units such as \glyph{units of information} and \glyph{state variables}.

Process nodes represent processes that transform one or several ENs into one or several different ENs.

\section{Connecting arcs}\label{sec:arcs}

Connecting arcs are lines that link EPNs and PNs together. The symbols attached to their extremities precise their semantics.
