\section{Relationships}\label{sec:relationships}

\glyph{Relationships} are rules that decide of the existence of entity nodes, based on the existence of others. 
%In ontology parlance, they would be ``occurants''. 
\SBGNERLone{} provides two types of relationships, the statements and the influences.

\subsection{Statements}\label{sec:statements}

\glyph{Statements} can be true or false. \glyph{Statements} are targets of \glyph{Influences}. They are not true themselves, but can  carry \glyph{Outcomes}( see \sect{outcome}). \SBGNERLone{} provides three types of statements, \glyph{Assignment}, \glyph{Interaction} and \glyph{Phenotype}.

\subsection{Influences}\label{sec:influences}

Influence arcs represent the effect of an entity on another relationship. The symbols attached to their extremities precise their semantics. SBGN \ERs{}' influences can be viewed as logical rules linking \glyph{ENs} and other rules. \SBGNERLone{} provides seven influences, \glyph{Modulation}, \glyph{Stimulation}, \glyph{Inhibition}, \glyph{Necessary Stimulation}, \glyph{Absolute Inhibition}, \glyph{Absolute Stimulation}, \glyph{Logic Arc}.
