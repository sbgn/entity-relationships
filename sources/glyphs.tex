[Note on the color code: \textcolor{blue}{The glyphs that have been thorougly discussed, and are considered frozen, are represented in blue}. \textcolor{green}{The glyphs that have been thorougly discussed, but are still posing problems are represented in green}. \textcolor{red}{The glyphs that have been proposed but for which in-depth discussion is yet to come are represented in red}.]

This chapter provides a catalog of the graphical symbols available for representing entities in \ER diagrams.  There are different classes of glyphs corresponding to different classes of entities, predicates, controls and operators.

In \chap{grammar} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:grammar}, we describe the rules for combining these glyphs into a legal SBGN \ER, and in \chap{layout} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:layout}, we describe requirements and guidelines for the way that diagrams are visually organized.

 \section{Interactor nodes}\label{sec:interactors}

\SBGNERLone{} contains four glyphs representing classes of interactors: \glyph{entity}, \glyph{perturbation}, \glyph{observable} and \glyph{outcome}. Entities can optionally carry auxiliary units such as \glyph{units of information} and \glyph{state variables}.

\section{influences}\label{sec:influences}

Influence arcs represent the effect of an entity on another relationship. The symbols attached to their extremities precise their semantics. \SBGNERLone's influences can be viewed as logical rules linking interactors and other rules.
