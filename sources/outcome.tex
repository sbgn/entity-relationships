\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Outcome}}\label{sec:outcome}

In \ERs, an \glyph{outcome} represents the actualisation of a \glyph{statement} (\sect{statements}). It is not an entity on its own, but a subset of all possible entity instances where \glyph{statement}  is true. For instance, if an \glyph{interaction} represents a non-covalent binding, the \glyph{outcome} represents all possible complexes that has two interactors bound to each other. If an \glyph{interaction} represents a genetic interaction, for instance derived from genetic screenings, the \glyph{outcome} represents the result of the presence of the two polymorphisms. If an \glyph{assignment} represents the phosphorylation of a protein, the \glyph{outcome} represents all possible complexes and free molecules where this protein is phosphorylated.

An \glyph{outcome} \corr{represent}{represents} a particular instance of a realisation, and therefore, from one outcome must depart only one influence. An outcome being an \glyph{entity node}, it cannot receive influences. It exists. It cannot more or less exist. 

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm SBO:0000409 ! interaction outcome

\glyphContainer  An \glyph{outcome} is represented by a black dot located on the arc of a \glyph{statement} (\sect{statements}). The diameter of the dot has to be larger than the thickness of the arc.

\glyphLabel An \glyph{outcome} has no identity on its own and does not carry any label. 

\glyphAux An \glyph{outcome} does not carry any auxiliary items.
