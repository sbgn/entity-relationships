\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Outcome}}\label{sec:outcome}

In \ER diagram, an \glyph{outcome} represents the actualisation of a \glyph{statement} (\sect{statements}) or an \glyph{influence} (\sect{influences}). For instance, if an \glyph{interaction} represents a non-covalent binding, the \glyph{outcome} represents the complex. If an \glyph{interaction} represents a genetic interaction, for instance derived from genetic screenings, the \glyph{outcome} represents the result of the presence of the two polymorphisms. If an \glyph{assignment} represents the phosphorylation of a protein, the \glyph{outcome} represents the phosphorylated form of this protein.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm SBO:0000409 ! interaction outcome

\glyphContainer  An \glyph{outcome} is represented by a black dot located on the arc of a \glyph{statement} (\sect{statements}) or an \glyph{influence} (\sect{influences}). The diameter of the dot has to be larger than the thickness of the arc.

\glyphLabel An \glyph{outcome} has no identity on its own and does not carry any label. 

\glyphAux An \glyph{outcome} does not carry any auxiliary items.
