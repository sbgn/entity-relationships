\section{Developments, discussions, and notifications of updates}
\label{sec:discussions}

The SBGN website (\url{http://sbgn.org/}) is a portal for all things related to SBGN.  It provides a web forum interface to the SBGN discussion list (\mailto{sbgn-discuss@caltech.edu}) and information about how anyone may subscribe to it.  The easiest and best way to get involved in SBGN discussions is to join the mailing list and participate.

Face-to-face meetings of the SBGN community are announced on the website as well as the mailing list.  Although no set schedule currently exists for workshops and other meetings, we envision holding at least one public workshop per year.  As with other similar efforts, the workshops are likely to be held as satellite workshops of larger conferences, enabling attendees to use their international travel time and money more efficiently.

Notifications of updates to the SBGN specification are also broadcast on the mailing list and announced on the SBGN website.
