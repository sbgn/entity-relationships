\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Necessary stimulation}}\label{sec:necessaryStimulation}

A \glyph{necessary stimulation} is an influence that has to be present for a relationship to take place (to become true). A relationship modulated by a necessary stimulation can only exist when this stimulation is true, whatever are the other influences this relationship is subjected to.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000171 ! necessary stimulation.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{entity node} (\sect{ENs}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{relationship} (\sect{relationships}).
 \glyphEndPoint The target extremity of a \glyph{necessary stimulation} carries an open arrow (to remind that it is a \glyph{stimulation}) coming after a larger vertical bar.
 \glyphAux A \glyph{unit of information} carrying the mention \glyph{cis} or \glyph{trans} precises the relationship between the \glyph{entity node} from which the \glyph{necessary stimulation} origins and either:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \glyph{entity node} from which the influence targeted by the \glyph{necessary stimulation} origins
\item all the relevant \glyph{interactors} of the \glyph{interaction} targeted by the \glyph{necessary stimulation}
\item the \glyph{entity} subjected to the \glyph{assignment} targeted by the \glyph{necessary stimulation}
\end{itemize}

 \end{glyphDescription}
