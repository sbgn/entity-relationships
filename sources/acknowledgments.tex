SBGN specifications are developed by many people, and with the support of many organisations.

\section{Main contributors}

In addition to the SBGN editors, the specification of SBGN ER benefited enormously from the contribution of many people. In particular, the specification of \SBGNERLone benefited much from deep discussions with Mirit Aladjem, Kurt Kohn, Emek Demir, Sohyoung Kim, Yukiko Matsuoka and Hiroaki Kitano. 

\section{Comprehensive list of contributors}

Here is a more comprehensive list of people who have been actively involved in SBGN development, either by their help designing the languages, their comments on the specification, help with development infrastructure or any other useful input.  We aim this list to be rather complete. We are very sorry if we forgot someone, and will be grateful if you notified us of any omission.
