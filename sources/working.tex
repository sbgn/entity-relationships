\section{Domains}\label{sec:unresolved_domain}

Domain would permit to define global and local auxiliary units, for instance global state variables (state of a ion channel pore) or local state variables (phosphorylation of a given subunit of a ion channel). The issue is not easy to resolve and the tentatives so far led to either problems of nesting or unsatisfactory identification and handling of global and local auxiliary units. Considering that 1) the attribution of an auxiliary unit does not change the semantics of a map, and is more like a sophisticated annotation, and 2) a map producer can always use several entities to represent different domains, it was felt that the issue should be postponed to a further level/version.
