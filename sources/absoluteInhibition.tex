\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Absolute inhibition}}\label{sec:absoluteInhibition}

An absolute inhibition precludes the existence of another relationship. A relationship modulated by an absolute inhibition can only exist when an absolute inhibition in false, whatever are the other influences this relationship is subjected to.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000171 ! absolute inhibition.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{entity node} (\sect{ENs}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{relationship} (\sect{relationships}).
 \glyphEndPoint The target extremity of a \glyph{absolute inhibition} carries a double bar perpendicular to the arc (to remind that it is an \glyph{inhibition}).
