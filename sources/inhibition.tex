\subsubsection{Glyph: \glyph{Inhibition}}\label{sec:inhibition}
%\color{blue}

An \glyph{inhibition} affects \textbf{negatively}  the strength, or the probability, of the target relationship. This inhibition can be for instance a steric hindrance or a negative allosteric regulation.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000170 ! inhibition.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{entity node} (\sect{ENs}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{relationship} (\sect{relationships}).
 \glyphEndPoint The target extremity of a \glyph{inhibition} carries a bar perpendicular to the arc.
 \glyphAux A \glyph{unit of information} carrying the mention \glyph{cis} or \glyph{trans} precises the relationship between the \glyph{entity node} from which the \glyph{inhibition} origins and either:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \glyph{entity node} from which the influence targeted by the \glyph{inhibition} origins
\item all the relevant \glyph{interactors} of the \glyph{interaction} targeted by the \glyph{inhibition}
\item the \glyph{entity} subjected to the \glyph{assignment} targeted by the \glyph{inhibition}
\end{itemize}
 \end{glyphDescription}
